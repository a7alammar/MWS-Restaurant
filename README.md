# Project Overview
For this project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application, taking a static design that lacks accessibility and converting the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating an offline experience for the users.

## How to Run It
In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
